        UI/UX <strong>Designer</strong> </br></br>
        My name is Vincent Tantardini, I'm a French UI/UX designer living in Lyon, fascinated by technology innovations, product branding and typography. I offer my design skills to build awesome websites and mobile applications in line with the ambitions of their owners.  What I love above all things is pushing the limits of ergonomics and conception without ever neglecting user experience. Let's work on great projects together.
